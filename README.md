# Blockchain_bookstore
Ethereum Dapp created to buy and sell books in a decentralized manner.

This app currently uses Truffle and Ganache for deployment and testing in the alpha version.
Users will be able to add books to the contract, with a set price for the uploaded book. Books
will have internal escrow contract bindings that allow for transactions to occur off the main contract,
to allow for better storage and efficiency.

Currently, there have been issues with running a single succesful contract, and next steps are to
run a successful transaction and test different amounts of funding with multiple accounts.

### Must Have:
#### Truffle installed with node.js
##### to use and test, run truffle commands in the main directory
